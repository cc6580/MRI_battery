Here is the code for reading in some experimental data (whole of section named "Read Battery Magnetometry Data").
You just have to change the path name to where the different experiment files are stored. 

At the end of these sections, newz and newy should then contain the loaded experimental data (the fields in the respective directions). 
Note that it is scaled by 1e-12 to get Tesla units, but you would still have to rescale them in the same way as your training data.

The rest of the code is older so you can just take the parts that read the experimental data and reshape them into the relevant tensor to make compatible with 
model predictions.
