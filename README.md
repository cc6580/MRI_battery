note:
All `.py` scripts that contain `grid_search` in its name can be ran under non grid searching mode (i.e., training just one particular model) when you just give each hyperparameter value a list that contains 1 entry. It will only be grid searching if for each hyperparameter value list there are more than 1 value present.
